Conway's law states that organizations will inevitably mirror their organizational communications structure in the technological systems they build. It follows, therefore, that an important part of designing a technological system is to build a proper organizational structure around it.

Currently, the _Interplanetary Publishing Protocol_ (hereafter referred to as _Intpub_) has no organizational structure. For this reason, it is important that we build Intpub's technology in a way that anticipates and mirrors the future structure of its organization and communications. Doing so will ensure that Intpub's technology is compatible with the use cases it is designed for.

Here, there is an important question to be asked: should the technology design of an open-source project be oriented around the communications structure of its developers or its end users?

The proposal put forth in this article is that the communications structure of research, academia, and science loosely resembles a forest. In this forest,researchers act as the roots of trees, by taking in information from the outside world and transforming that information into the fruits of knowledge. Then, the tree's fruits potentiate the growth of new ideas by fertilizing the

To further understand this, it is necessary to understand which mechanisms and processes underlie the knowledge creation pipeline.

The principal end goal of research is to accumulate and create knowledge. In science, this knowledge is usually represented in the form of empirical facts, theorems, and principles. In other academic disciplines, knowledge is also represented in less structured mediums like art and literature.

At the core, all forms of academic knowledge are encoded as information. This information is usually encoded in language and text, but for notation-heavy disciplines like mathematics. N

The goal of this article is not to describe the actual process of knowledge creation, as there are many different processes for creating knowledge, most of which share little in common. Rather, our goal is to produce a metaphorical representation of the infrastructure used to create, process, disseminate, and analyze knowledge. Doing this will allow us to more accurately mirror the structure of knowledge communications in developing Intpub.

The structure of this network therefore represents a tree. This is the eponymic $|WRONGWORD| should be "relating to the name of the title"$ Tree of Knowledge Creation.
